# Phonebook

This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries

# File Transfer GUI

This project allows the user to transfer files between one chosen directory to another with the moved files being saved in a database. It also checks for files modified in the past 24 hours and moves them automatically.

# Campus App

This is part of a larger "Django University" website. This portion sets the model for "University Campus" to allow for a user-modified DB of campus information on the website. 

# Checkbook App

This is a web-based checkbook app that allows one to create an acccount, make deposits or withdrawals, and get information about these transactions.
